# Conditional (Ternary) Operators in TypeScript

Conditional operators, often referred to as ternary operators, provide a concise way to express conditional (if-else) logic in a single line of code. In TypeScript, these operators are useful for making decisions and assigning values based on conditions.

This documentation explains how to use conditional operators in your TypeScript project and provides examples of common scenarios.

## Introduction

Conditional operators in TypeScript, denoted by the `?` and `:` symbols, allow you to evaluate a condition and return one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false. This is especially handy for concise assignments and expressions.

## Syntax

The syntax of a conditional operator in TypeScript is as follows:

```typescript
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```
