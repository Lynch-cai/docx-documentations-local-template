# Asynchronous Operations with async/await

In modern JavaScript and TypeScript development, asynchronous programming is crucial for handling tasks that may take time to complete, such as fetching data from a server or reading/writing to a database. The `async/await` feature provides a more readable and structured way to work with asynchronous operations.

This documentation explains how to use `async/await` in your TypeScript project and provides examples of common scenarios.

## Introduction

`async/await` is a syntactical feature in TypeScript (and JavaScript) that simplifies working with promises and asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous-looking fashion, making it easier to read and maintain.

Key points to remember:

-   An `async` function returns a promise.
-   Inside an `async` function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution until a promise is resolved.

## Using async/await

### Defining an async Function

To create an asynchronous function, use the `async` keyword before the `function` keyword. For example:

```typescript
async function fetchData() {
    // Asynchronous operations here
    const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    return data.json();
}
```
